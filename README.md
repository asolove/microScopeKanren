Micro Scope Kanren
==================

The relation between you and your logic program.

A JavaScript implementation of MicroKanren (plus macros for MiniKanren)
focused on inspecting logic programs as they run.

The goal is to be able to see how your program runs: how do different 
parts of the program interleave answers?
